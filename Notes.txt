CI/CD:
    Continues integration and continues development.
    All the software that we use whether it's a website or app or any operating system.
    They are in a continued state of change. We need to continuously develop and update
    this software so that the
    customer can use this features.

1) Once the software is ready and looks good on the developers machine. Developer pushes that code to the development
server. He verifies the changes and runs a few test cases to make sure all works fine.
2) Once all looks good QA will request to deploy changes on QA server. We also need to get approvals from team lead or
managers.
3) Once all looks good on QA take approval from head of team write an email again to deploy all the changes to staging
server.
4) Once all look good on staging do the same for the production.
